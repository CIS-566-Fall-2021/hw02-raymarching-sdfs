Techniques:
This project showcases a scene from the Pixar film Soul in which Joe falls in to the Great Before. The scene is generated using SDFs, created by placing and combining geometry, and raymarching to find intersections in the scene. Currently, there is lambert reflection using estimated normals. A basic model of Joe falls down and rotates over time into the ground. And finally there is basic shadows.
