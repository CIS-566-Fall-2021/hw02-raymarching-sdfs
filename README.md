## Cylinders
- Performed opRepLim on a block of cylinders and smooth subtracted them from the floor plane
- Did the same function on a block of cylinders with a slightly smaller radius to give the illusion that they are coming in and out of the floor
- Applied a cosine function to the cylinder heights and floored the input in order to keep the cylinder tops unwarped


## Pendulum
- Smooth blended a sphere and a rod together to create a pendulum
- Applied a smoothstep pulsing function to the y coordinate of the pendulum and a cos to the z coordinate to create a swinging motion

## Notes
I really liked the look of the 3D rendered satisfying videos - so I took inspiration from one I found online! In the future I will be timing the swing of the pendulum to follow exactly the wave of the cylinders. I would also like to add more balls to scene to make it a bit more complex looking.
