# CIS 566 Homework 3: Advanced Raymarched Scenes

## Objective
- Gain experience with signed distance functions
- Experiment with animation curves
- Create a presentable portfolio piece

## Base Code

You will copy your implementation of hw02 into your hw03 repository.

## Assignment Requirements
- __(35 points) Artwork Replication__ Your raymarched scene should attempt to replicate the appearance of your inspiration (include picture) with clear effort put into the replication.
- __(25 points) Materials__ Your scene should be composed of at least three different materials. We define a material to be a surface reflection model combined with some base surface color; texturing is optional.
- __(10 points) Lighting and Shadows__ Light your scene with at least three light sources. At least one of your light sources must cast shadows, and they should be soft shadows using the penumbra shadows algorithm we discussed in class. Consider following the "Key Light, Fill Light, GI Light" formulation from the in-class example.
- __(20 points) Performance__ The frame rate of your scene must be at least 10FPS.
- __(10 points)__ Following the specifications listed
[here](https://github.com/pjcozzi/Articles/blob/master/CIS565/GitHubRepo/README.md),
create your own README.md, renaming this file to INSTRUCTIONS.md. Don't worry
about discussing runtime optimization for this project. Make sure your
README contains the following information:
  - Your name and PennKey
  - Citation of any external resources you found helpful when implementing this
  assignment.
  - A link to your live github.io demo
  - An explanation of the techniques you used to model and animate your scene.
